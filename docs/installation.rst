Installation
============

Install Python
--------------

To use `sap10calcs`, you will need Python installed on your computer.

There are a different ways to do this. I would recommend installing the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__ which installs Python itself and many other useful Python packages such as `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__  and `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__. 

Install pip
-----------

`sap10calcs` is provided for downloading and installation by being hosted on the Python Packaging Index, `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`__.

To install Python packages, please make sure you have the `pip` package installed (it is likely that pip is already installed as a part of your Python installation).
